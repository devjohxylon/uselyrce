# Admin Panel Advanced Features

## Overview

The Usely admin panel has been upgraded with real-time WebSocket updates, advanced analytics, live map visualization, and comprehensive player profile management.

## New Features

### 1. Real-Time WebSocket Updates ✅

**What it does:**
- Live server status updates every 3 seconds
- Real-time player join/leave notifications
- Instant kill event broadcasts
- Live player position updates for map
- No more page refreshing needed

**Technical Implementation:**
- Socket.IO server at `/admin/socket.io`
- Authenticated connections using session cookies
- Broadcasts: `server:update`, `players:update`, `kill:new`, `player:join`, `player:leave`, `alert:new`
- Auto-reconnection on disconnect

**Files:**
- `src/server/websocket.js` - WebSocket server
- `src/bot.js` - Integration with bot lifecycle
- `src/modules/rcon/feeds.js` - Broadcasting integration

### 2. Analytics Dashboard ✅

**What it shows:**
- Peak and average player counts (24 hours)
- Average server FPS
- Active player count (unique players last 30 days)
- Player activity chart (hourly peaks over 24h)
- Top 10 weapons by kills
- Server performance chart (FPS over last hour)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Historical data tracking in `.data/analytics.json`
- Hourly player count sampling
- Weapon kill statistics
- Server performance metrics (FPS, entities, players)
- Chart.js for visualizations
- Data retention: 7 days for hourly, 30 days for daily

**Files:**
- `src/modules/analytics/tracker.js` - Data collection
- `src/data/store.js` - Persistence layer
- Admin panel HTML - Chart rendering with Chart.js

**API Endpoints:**

### 3. Live Map Visualization ✅

**What it shows:**
- Real-time player positions on 2D grid
- Player IGN labels

- 4000x4000 map size assumption (configurable)
- Grid overlay for reference
- Updates via WebSocket `players:update` event
- Position data from RCON client

**Files:**
- Admin panel HTML - Canvas drawing logic
- `src/server/websocket.js` - Position broadcasting
- `src/modules/rcon/client.js` - Player position retrieval

---

### 4. Player Profile System ✅

**What it tracks:**
- Player notes (staff can add/remove)
- Tags (VIP, Toxic, Streamer, etc.)
- Warning history with reasons
- Stats integration (kills, deaths, K/D, playtime)
- Activity data (first seen, last seen, days active)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Profile storage in `.data/player-profiles.json`
- Search functionality across IGN, tags, and notes
- Staff attribution for notes and warnings
- Auto-cleanup of inactive players (30 days)

**Files:**
- `src/modules/profiles/manager.js` - Profile management
- `src/server/admin/api.js` - API endpoints
- `src/data/store.js` - Persistence

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /admin/api/profiles` - List/search profiles
- `GET /admin/api/profiles/:ign` - Get player profile
- `POST /admin/api/profiles/:ign/notes` - Add note
- `DELETE /admin/api/profiles/:ign/notes/:noteId` - Remove note
- `POST /admin/api/profiles/:ign/tags` - Add tag

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Not Connecting
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `BOT_WEBHOOK_PORT` is accessible
- Ensure session is authenticated
- Try refreshing the page

### Charts Not Showing
- Ensure Chart.js CDN is loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify analytics data exists (`/admin/api/analytics`)
- Wait for data collection (may take a few minutes)

### Map Shows No Players
- Verify RCON is connected
- Check if players are actually online
- Ensure WebSocket is connected
- Player positions require RCON support

### Data Not Persisting
- Verify Railway volume is mounted at `/app/.data`
- Check DATA_DIR environment variable
- Review persistence warnings in logs
- Ensure write permissions on data directory
